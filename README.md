# Faster-RCNN-Pytorch
### 1. Introduction
Pytorch based implementation of faster rcnn framework.For details about faster R-CNN please refer to the paper Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun

This detection framework has the following features:

* It can be run as pure python code, and also pure based on pytorch framework, no need to build
* It is easily trained by only running a train.py script, just set the data root dir
* It has many backbone networks. like vgg, resnet-fpn, mobilenet, high resolution net(HRNet)
* It can be a really detection framework. You only need to change super parameters in config file and get different models to compare different model
* It's memory-efficient (about 3GB for vgg16)
